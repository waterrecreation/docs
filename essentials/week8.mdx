    Borroe Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project integrating artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, is expected to grow exponentially with its upcoming airdrop.

After raising $4.5 million at presale, Borroe Finance's governance token, $ROE, is set to be listed on various crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, XRP faces a potential sell-off due to the emergence of a bearish 'death cross' formation.

1. **Microsoftâ€™s new â€˜Black Mirrorâ€™ recall feature records everything you do** 
    
    Microsoft is introducing a new AI-powered feature called "Recall" for select Windows 11 PCs. This feature records user activity, taking periodic screenshots of user interactions. It allows users to scroll through a visual timeline to find previously viewed content from any application, website, or document. Users can control privacy by deleting individual snapshots, adjusting time ranges, pausing the recording, or filtering out certain apps or websites. However, concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of personal data to train the company's AI models.

3. **Scarlett Johansson told OpenAI not to use her voice â€” andÂ sheâ€™sÂ not happy they might have anyway**  
    
    Scarlett Johansson has hired legal counsel and is seeking transparency from OpenAI after the company's AI voice assistant, known as Sky, was found to sound eerily similar to her own voice. Johansson claims she declined an offer from OpenAI's Sam Altman to voice the ChatGPT 4.0 system, and was shocked when Sky's voice was released. OpenAI has since paused using Sky's voice and insists it was not intended to resemble Johansson's. The company is currently in conversation with Johansson's representatives over their concerns.
